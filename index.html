      Building a PC has become a popular hobby to do in the most recent years. A
      lot of gamers now a days wants to go from using consoles such as the
      PlayStation and Xbox to using a PC. Honestly, I do not blame them to
      change the way they game. You can do so many things on computer then a
      console. For example, you can

      </ul>

      multitask your favorite game and your homework, you can stream and control
      your stream, and many more.

        Their is different types of computers you can choose from:
        <code>computer tower, laptop, and tablets.</code> It all depends on your
        preference and how you will use it. Personally, I like having a
        mid-tower computer, I can double task using my double monitors and do
        code in one monitor while looking at my other monitor and seeing the
        changes
      </p>
      <p>
        I also have a Mac laptop, I use it for on the go. It all depends on how
        you will use this machine and how often.

      <p>
        The advantages of building a PC is you can make it however you please.
        Is your favorite color red? Well you can customize your whole PC to be a
        red color theme. This build all depends on you and what you like. It
        will be your own masterpiece!
      </p>
      <p>
        The last reason for building a PC is that it is cheaper then buying a
        prebuilt tower. When you buy a prebuilt, you sometimes don't get the
        best computer parts for the price they as for. When building your own,
        you get the best parts for your <code> money!!!</code>

    <section class="main-section" id="CPU">
      <header>CPU</header>
      <p>
        Time to build a PC! First I recommend to choose what processor(CPU) you
        like. I also recommend that you research more about the processor you
        like. It all depends on your budget, performance of the programs or
        games you want to use, or the if you are willing to overclock your
        processor. I suggest you spend around <code>$300.</code>
      </p>
      <p>
        The next part is a <code>CPU cooler</code>, you can either spend the
        extra $200 for a water cooler to keep cooler and less noisy or just use
        to stock fan that comes with the processor.

    <section class="main-section" id="Motherboard">
      <header>Motherboard</header>
      <p>
        The next part is the motherboard, the brain of the computer. When
        picking one make sure that it is a mid-tower or a atx. You want to
        choose one with the matching socket type of your processor. Lastly, for
        ram you want to choose the speed of your PC. I suggest using a 12Gb ram
        for casual using or 32Gb for gaming. Just make sure it is a DDR4
        motherboard support and DDR4 ram.

    <section class="main-section" id="Storage">
      <header>Storage</header>
      <p>
        For storage, I suggest to get a SSD drive, which is more expensive, to
        install your operating system. You can either get another large SSD for
        more storage or get a HDD since they are bigger storage drives and
        cheaper.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>HDD</li>
        <li>SDD</li>
        <li>External Drives</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Video_Card(GPU)">
      <header>Video Card(GPU)</header>
      <p>
        This is the important part, in my opinion. I am a big gamer and always
        want to keep up with the current graphics with my favorite games.
        Therefore, I go for more of an expensive and latest graphics card. I
        suggest to spend <code>$700-$900</code>, once again depending on your
        budget.

    <section class="main-section" id="Computer_Case">
      <header>Computer Case</header>
      <p>
        Once all your parts are chosen you want to choose the right computer
        case. Most cheap cases tend to be heavier then somewhat expensive cases.
        You also want to make sure that all your chosen parts are able to fit.
        Lastly, you want to make sure that their is a lot of airflow for the
        computer to be kept cool.
      </p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Power_Supply">
      <header>Power Supply</header>
      <p>
        For power supply, I suggest that you choose one that adds up to the
        estimate watts usage you will need. You also want to invest in a good
        power supply because it is what powers up your computer.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <p>Power Supply Options</p>
        <li>Plat</li>
        <li>Gold</li>
        <li>Silver</li>
        <li>Bronze</li>
